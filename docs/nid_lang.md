# Nimble Instructional Design (NID)

## Nimble Instructional Design
NID or NID-lang is our own high level language for easy development, safer and high performant code.  
NID-lang is C-like in syntax and attempts give the coder full control over the code, while abstracting away
the inconvenience of assembly language or ASS.
