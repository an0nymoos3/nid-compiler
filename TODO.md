# TODO

## Variable storing rework
- Keep the current "push and pop" approach.
- Keep the memory map for mapping where memory is stored in the program?

## Function stacks
- Parse entire function at the beginning to find all variable declerations.
- Allocate entire region in memory for the function variables? (Could create seperation of variables)
- Pop entire region at the end.

## Globals
- Allocate all global variables in the beginning of the program.
- Dedicated memory map for globals?
